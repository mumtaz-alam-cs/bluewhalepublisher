      <h4> Terms and Definitions </h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> All online information on Blue Whale Publishers website pages is referred to as “website.” </p>
      <p> “Customer,” “You,” or “Yours” refer to you and/or any other person making an order on your behalf to Blue Whale Publishers. </p>
      <p> Blue Whale Publishers, a business registered under the laws of Massachusetts, is referred to as “Company,” “We,” or “Our.”

      </p>
      <p> “Product” refers to all services and goods delivered to the Customer in line with his or her Order by Blue Whale Publishers. </p>
      <p> “Order” refers to a Customer’s request to purchase services or products from Blue Whale Publishers by phone or email. Down payments through credit card, cash receipt, or bank wire transfer are required to finalize orders. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4> REFUND POLICY </h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> To fully appreciate the benefits and limits defined by the Blue Whale Publishers Policy, it is critical that you read and completely comprehend the return policy. Only in exceptional circumstances and under specific conditions can we provide refunds, as described below: </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4> Change of Mind </h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> Before our writers/editors begin working on the assignment, the buyer is entitled to a 100% refund. If you change your mind after placing your purchase and decide not to continue your project with us for whatever reason, you can request a refund within the first hour after placing your order. In all other situations, a 15% processing fee will be applied. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4> Incompetent Delivery </h4>
      <p> Customers are only entitled to a refund after they have exhausted all of the alternatives listed below; if the work does not meet the project criteria (as requested/documented by the client). We are dedicated to ensuring that our customers are completely satisfied, and we offer limitless changes to guarantee that the delivery meets their expectations. To ensure total satisfaction, we assign, re-assign, and re-write your job. You can save FREE Pages for the future, but they will have the same value, and you can use them at any moment. </p>
      <br />
      <p> If we are still unable to provide what you have requested, a refund will be issued based on a mutually agreed-upon proportion (but only in the cases where the delivery is completely off the mark). </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4> Delivery Errors </h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> We believe in “On Time Delivery,” however if we fail to deliver the requested service on time after three efforts to reach us, your refund will be handled if documentation evidence establishes that the late delivery was the company’s fault. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4> Timeline for Refunds </h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> Within 60 days after delivery, you must request a refund. Refund requests made after the deadline will not be considered. Customers should keep in mind the deadline for requesting a refund when placing an order. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4> Cases in which a refund will not be given </h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> In the event of a late delivery owing to minor technical issues such as grammar, typing, word count, missing references, and so on, reimbursements will be handled after mutual agreement, and the firm will only settle with a partial refund or discounts saved for future orders. The firm shall not be held liable for any delays caused by the client. </p>
      <br>
      <p> Any and all disciplinary proceedings stemming from the inappropriate, unethical, and/or illegal use of content purchased through our Website are completely the responsibility of the customer. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4> Clause of Application </h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> If a project has been abandoned in terms of approvals or specifications for a period of at least 45 days due to a lack of written contract between the customer and the account manager, the project will be considered closed. The project will be reactivated at a cost. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4> Project has been completed </h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> A “closed project” is one that has been completed or has not been claimed for at least 45 days, and for which Blue Whale Publishers cannot be held accountable once that time period has passed. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4> Personal Use & Copyright </h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> The Products that are supplied to You are entirely unique. You and you alone own the complete copyright to the Products and any content supplied to you. You undertake to indemnify, defend, and hold the Company harmless for any and all unauthorized uses of the Company’s materials made accessible to you. Any unauthorized use of this Website’s supplied Products and/or content may result in civil or criminal consequences. </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4> Plagiarism is prohibited. </h4>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p> Plagiarism, or any other act of fraud or dishonesty, is not tolerated, encouraged, or knowingly participated in by us. All copyright laws are strictly enforced by us, and we will not knowingly enable any Customer to plagiarise or breach copyright laws. </p>
      <br />
      <p> The Company, its affiliates, and/or partners are not responsible for any unethical, improper, illegal, or otherwise unlawful use of the Products and/or other written content obtained from our Website.

      <br />
      <br />
      <h4> Our image policy is as follows: </h4>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p> We do not hold the rights to photos unless they are expressly produced by our in-house artists, thus we do not utilize them. We’ll just send you URLs to recommended photos that you may copy and paste into your own website. You can use royalty-free photos without fear, but you may have to pay the owner if the image is copyrighted. </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4> Refunds </h4>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p> If you seek a refund before we begin working on your ordered goods, we will return 100% of your payment (except the transaction charges that will be deducted). Once an order has been delivered, you are no longer entitled to a full refund. We will not give a refund once an Order has been begun since the hours invested in the project cannot be recovered. The provided Products and Services are non-refundable and come with no explicit or implied guarantees. You may, however, request up to one free revision. If you are not completely happy with the quality of the product/services, you may request a 50% refund of the fee amount paid. </p>
      <br />
      <p> We will arrange a refund of 50% of the charge amount when we have verified the quality problems you have raised. If you have a unique complaint situation and want a complete refund, your case will be submitted to an assessment committee, which will make a fair judgment based on facts and evidence. </p>

      <br />
      <br />
      <h4> Revision Restrictions </h4>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p> Editing Orders: We’ll go over the revised information again to make sure there are no more objective or technical mistakes. Any future changes to the material are supplied at the sole discretion of the Company if no objective or technical mistakes exist in the content. </p>
